R code for downloading NBA play-by-play data for the 2017-18 season

I will be updating the data as the season progresses but you can download recent games using the provided script.  

The variable n.games is set to the number of games played thus far in the season. For example, the first game of the season was BOS@CLE, while the second HOU@GW and so on. 

If you use these data please cite this github repo.

Contact me with any questions.
